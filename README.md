# Reinforcement Learning Project

Welcome to my Reinforcement Learning project repository! This project is a collection of implementations and experiments related to various reinforcement learning algorithms. The repository is currently under active development, with more algorithms and experiments to be added in the future.



## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following folders, each corresponding to a specific algorithm or topic:

1. **MDP (Value Iteration)**
   - **Code**: Implementation of the Value Iteration algorithm for solving Markov Decision Processes (MDPs).
   - **Experiment Report**: Documentation of the experiments conducted using Value Iteration.
   - **Results**: Outputs and insights from the experiments.
2. **CliffWalk**
   - **Code**: Implementation of the Cliff Walking environment and associated algorithms.
   - **Experiment Report**: Detailed analysis and findings from experiments.
   - **Results**: Visualizations and data from the experiments.
3. **DQN (Deep Q-Network)**
   - **Code**: Implementation of the Deep Q-Network algorithm.
   - **Experiment Report**: Analysis of the DQN experiments, including hyperparameter tuning and performance metrics.
   - **Results**: Reward curves.



## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Tue2day/Reinforcement-Learning.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the desired folder**:

   ```bash
   cd Reinforcement-Learning/CliffWalk  # Example for CliffWalk
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   Ensure you have the required libraries installed. You can install them using `pip`:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the code**:
   Execute the scripts to reproduce the experiments or modify them for your own use.

## Future Updates

This project is a work in progress. I plan to add more reinforcement learning algorithms and experiments in the future.

Stay tuned for updates!
